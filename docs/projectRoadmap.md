- [ ] nginx reverse proxy configuration
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificate setup
- [ ] Production environment testing
- [ ] Claude desktop production testing

### Phase 5: API Tools (Planned üìã)
- [ ] Resource listing and retrieval
- [ ] Resource creation and updates
- [ ] Search across resources
- [ ] Workflow operations
- [ ] User management
- [ ] Asset upload and management
- [ ] Metadata operations

### Phase 6: Enhanced Features (Future üîÆ)

- [ ] Comprehensive monitoring and alerting

## Progress History

### January 2025
**Week 1-2: Foundation and OAuth Integration**
- Updated MCP SDK from v1.11.0 to v1.20.1
- Removed Cloudflare Workers artifacts
- Implemented Streamable HTTP transport with Express.js
- Integrated OAuth 2.0 with PKCE via OAuth bridge
- Created three core authentication tools
- Comprehensive documentation overhaul
- Build verification successful

**Current Status:** Ready for testing and deployment phase

### December 2024 - May 2024
**Initial Development**
- Created initial MCP server with stdio transport
- Implemented direct IB API browser-based authentication
- Set up development workflow with dev/prod separation
- Created installation scripts for local deployment
- Basic documentation structure

## Technical Debt

### To Be Removed
- [ ] `src/auth.ts` - Legacy direct IB API authentication
- [ ] `src/auth-state.ts` - Legacy polling-based state management
- [ ] `scripts/dev-install.sh` - Legacy local installation (may repurpose)
- [ ] `scripts/prod-install.sh` - Legacy local installation (may repurpose)

### To Be Refactored
- [ ] Error handling standardization
- [ ] Logging implementation
- [ ] Type definitions cleanup in `src/types.ts`

## Risk Mitigation

### Security Risks
- ‚úì OAuth 2.0 with PKCE prevents code interception
- ‚úì HTTPS required for production
- ‚úì CORS configured for allowed origins only
- ‚úì DNS rebinding protection enabled
- ‚è≥ Token storage security (client responsibility)
- ‚è≥ Rate limiting (planned)

### Operational Risks
- ‚è≥ Single EC2 instance (plan for HA)
- ‚è≥ No automated backups yet
- ‚è≥ Manual deployment process
- üìã No monitoring/alerting yet

### Development Risks
- ‚úì Comprehensive documentation reduces knowledge gaps
- ‚úì Type safety with TypeScript
- ‚è≥ No automated testing yet
- üìã No CI/CD pipeline

## Success Metrics
